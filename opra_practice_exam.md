## Question 1
**A patient with a history of asthma is prescribed propranolol. Why should this be avoided?**  
A. It causes sedation   
B. It increases blood pressure   
C. It can cause bronchoconstriction   
D. It has no effect on asthma   

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer**: **C. - It can cause bronchoconstriction**.    

**Explanation**: Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can worsen asthma by blocking beta-2 receptors in the lungs.  

**Why others are wrong:**   
A. Propranolol is not primarily a sedative.   
B. It lowers, rather than increases, blood pressure.   
D. It does have a significant effect on asthma.

## Question 2
**A patient with hypertension is prescribed lisinopril. Which of the following is the most common side effect of this medication?**  
A. Hyperkalemia  
B. Dry cough  
C. Hypoglycemia  
D. Tachycardia  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>   

**Correct Answer: B - Dry cough**  
**Explanation**: Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is associated with a dry cough in up to 20% of patients due to the accumulation of bradykinin.  
**Why Others Are Wrong:**  
A. Hyperkalemia can occur but is less common than a dry cough.  
C. Hypoglycemia is not associated with lisinopril.  
D. Tachycardia is not a typical side effect of lisinopril.   
</details>

## Question 3
**A patient with asthma is prescribed a salbutamol inhaler. What is the primary mechanism of action of salbutamol?**  
A. Inhibition of leukotrienes  
B. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist  
C. Muscarinic receptor antagonist  
D. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase  


<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B. - Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist**  
**Explanation: Salbutamol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, providing rapid relief of asthma symptoms.**  
**Why Others Are Wrong:**  
A. Leukotriene inhibitors (e.g., montelukast) are used for long-term control, not acute relief.  
C. Muscarinic antagonists (e.g., ipratropium) are not the primary mechanism of salbutamol.  
D. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., theophylline) are not related to salbutamol.

## Question 1
**Which property influences a drug's ability to dissolve in water?**

A) Molecular weight  
B) Lipophilicity  
C) pKa  
D) All of the above  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** D) All of the above  
  **Explanation:** Solubility is affected by molecular weight, lipophilicity, and pKa. Larger molecules dissolve less easily, lipophilicity affects partitioning, and pKa determines ionization in different pH environments.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Molecular weight (A):** Only one factor, not the complete answer.  
  - **Lipophilicity (B):** Affects solubility but not alone.  
  - **pKa (C):** Important but not the only factor.  
</details>

## Question 2
**Why is drug stability important in formulations?**

A) It prevents microbial contamination  
B) It ensures the drug remains effective over time  
C) It enhances the taste of the drug  
D) It increases the weight of the drug  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** B) It ensures the drug remains effective over time  
  **Explanation:** Drug stability ensures the medication maintains potency and efficacy.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Microbial contamination (A):** Managed by preservatives, not stability alone.  
  - **Enhances taste (C):** Stability does not directly affect taste.  
  - **Increases weight (D):** Stability has no impact on drug weight.  
</details>

## Question 3
**Which of the following affects drug solubility?**

A) pH of the solution  
B) Route of administration  
C) Dosage form  
D) All of the above  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** A) pH of the solution  
  **Explanation:** The pH affects ionization and solubility.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Route of administration (B):** Determines how a drug is delivered but not solubility.  
  - **Dosage form (C):** Affects absorption but not direct solubility.
