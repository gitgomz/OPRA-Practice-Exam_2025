## Question 1
**Which organ is primarily responsible for detoxifying blood and metabolizing drugs?**

A) Heart  
B) Kidneys  
C) Liver  
D) Lungs  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** C) Liver  
  
  **Explanation:** The liver is the primary organ responsible for detoxification and drug metabolism through enzymatic processes, primarily via the cytochrome P450 system.  
  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Heart (A):** Pumps blood but does not metabolize drugs.  
  - **Kidneys (B):** Filter waste but do not primarily metabolize drugs.  
  - **Lungs (D):** Involved in gas exchange, not drug metabolism.  
</details>

## Question 2
**Which of the following is a key characteristic of an inflammatory response?**

A) Decreased blood flow  
B) Increased white blood cell activity  
C) Lowered body temperature  
D) Decreased capillary permeability  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** B) Increased white blood cell activity  
  **Explanation:** Inflammation is characterized by increased white blood cell activity to fight infection.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Decreased blood flow (A):** Inflammation actually increases blood flow.  
  - **Lowered body temperature (C):** Fever is a common inflammatory response.  
  - **Decreased capillary permeability (D):** Inflammation increases permeability to allow immune cells to reach affected areas.  
</details>

## Question 3
**Which microorganism is most commonly associated with tuberculosis?**

A) Staphylococcus aureus  
B) Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
C) Escherichia coli  
D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** B) Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
  **Explanation:** Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Staphylococcus aureus (A):** Causes skin infections, not tuberculosis.  
  - **Escherichia coli (C):** Associated with gastrointestinal infections.  
  - **Pseudomonas aeruginosa (D):** Causes opportunistic infections, not tuberculosis.

## Question 1
**Which property influences a drug's ability to dissolve in water?**

A) Molecular weight  
B) Lipophilicity  
C) pKa  
D) All of the above  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** D) All of the above  
  **Explanation:** Solubility is affected by molecular weight, lipophilicity, and pKa. Larger molecules dissolve less easily, lipophilicity affects partitioning, and pKa determines ionization in different pH environments.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Molecular weight (A):** Only one factor, not the complete answer.  
  - **Lipophilicity (B):** Affects solubility but not alone.  
  - **pKa (C):** Important but not the only factor.  
</details>

## Question 2
**Why is drug stability important in formulations?**

A) It prevents microbial contamination  
B) It ensures the drug remains effective over time  
C) It enhances the taste of the drug  
D) It increases the weight of the drug  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** B) It ensures the drug remains effective over time  
  **Explanation:** Drug stability ensures the medication maintains potency and efficacy.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Microbial contamination (A):** Managed by preservatives, not stability alone.  
  - **Enhances taste (C):** Stability does not directly affect taste.  
  - **Increases weight (D):** Stability has no impact on drug weight.  
</details>

## Question 3
**Which of the following affects drug solubility?**

A) pH of the solution  
B) Route of administration  
C) Dosage form  
D) All of the above  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** A) pH of the solution  
  **Explanation:** The pH affects ionization and solubility.  
  **Why other choices are wrong:**  
  - **Route of administration (B):** Determines how a drug is delivered but not solubility.  
  - **Dosage form (C):** Affects absorption but not direct solubility.
