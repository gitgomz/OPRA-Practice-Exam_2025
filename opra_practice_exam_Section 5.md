D. It has no effect on asthma   

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer**: **C. - It can cause bronchoconstriction**.    

**Explanation**: Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can worsen asthma by blocking beta-2 receptors in the lungs.

B. Dry cough  
C. Hypoglycemia  
D. Tachycardia  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>   

**Correct Answer: B - Dry cough**  
**Explanation**: Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is associated with a dry cough in up to 20% of patients due to the accumulation of bradykinin.

A. Hyperkalemia can occur but is less common than a dry cough.  
C. Hypoglycemia is not associated with lisinopril.  
D. Tachycardia is not a typical side effect of lisinopril.

D. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase  

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B. - Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist**  
**Explanation: Salbutamol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, providing rapid relief of asthma symptoms.**  
**Why Others Are Wrong:**  
A. Leukotriene inhibitors (e.g., montelukast) are used for long-term control, not acute relief.  
C. Muscarinic antagonists (e.g., ipratropium) are not the primary mechanism of salbutamol.

**Explanation: Nitrofurantoin is a first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs due to its efficacy and low resistance rates.**  

**Why Others Are Wrong:**  
A. Amoxicillin is not first-line due to high resistance rates.  
B. Ciprofloxacin is reserved for complicated UTIs or when first-line options fail.  
D. Vancomycin is used for severe infections like MRSA, not UTIs.

B. Folic acid  
C. Iron  
D. Vitamin B12  
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
  
**Correct Answer: B. - Folic acid**  
**Explanation**: Folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of methotrexate-induced side effects like mucositis and hematologic toxicity.  
**Why Others Are Wrong**:  
A. Vitamin D is not directly related to methotrexate side effects.  
C. Iron is not routinely co-prescribed with methotrexate.  
D. Vitamin B12 is not used to mitigate methotrexate side effects.
</details>

## **6. Which of the following is a common side effect of statins?**  
  
A. Hypoglycemia  
B. Myalgia  
C. Hypertension  
D. Hypokalemia  

<details>
 <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  
**Correct Answer: B. - Myalgia**  
**Explanation**: Statins are associated with muscle-related side effects, including myalgia and, in severe cases, rhabdomyolysis.  
**Why Others Are Wrong:**  
A. Hypoglycemia is not associated with statins.  
C. Statins do not cause hypertension.  
D. Hypokalemia is not a typical side effect of statins.  
</details>

## **7. A patient with osteoporosis is prescribed alendronate. What is the most important administration instruction for this medication?**  
A. Take with food  
B. Take at bedtime  
C. Take on an empty stomach with water and remain upright for 30 minutes  
D. Take with a high-fat meal  
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
  
**Correct Answer: C. Take on an empty stomach with water and remain upright for 30 minutes**  
**Explanation:** Alendronate must be taken on an empty stomach with water and the patient must remain upright to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation.  
**Why Others Are Wrong:**  
A. Taking with food reduces absorption.  
B. Taking at bedtime increases the risk of esophageal irritation.  
D. A high-fat meal reduces absorption.  
</details>

A. Naloxone  
B. N-acetylcysteine  
C. Flumazenil  
D. Vitamin K  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>

D. Prevent breakdown of levodopa in the brain  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  
**Correct Answer: B. - Inhibit peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine**

A. Carbidopa does not enhance dopamine release.  
C. Carbidopa is not a dopamine agonist.  
D. Carbidopa does not act in the brain.
